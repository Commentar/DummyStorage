DummyStorage
=

This is the most basic storage library for the [Commentar][commentar] project.

It is installed by default when first installing the [Commentar][commentar] system.

This storage library is an easy way to get dummy data and is very useful when testing the application or when creating themes. Other than that you probably want to install a real storage library (like database storage) for production.
